# pong_shoot
Project of game from my childhood which I can not find anywhere :-) 

This game was something very close to classic pong or pinball where You bounce 
the ball by bat and need to destroy bricks. But the feature was that You could
shoot those bricks with whole choice of guns. Which You could buy in store after
You passed the level. Currency was gold coins and blue diamonds.
